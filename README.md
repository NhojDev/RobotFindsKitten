## Description
I wanted to make the game experience more of a grind and have little bit of mystery vibe to Robot Finds Kitten so I added a fog around the player to make harder to see all the objects. I also added items that basically don't belong among the other items so try and create a sense of mystery to the game. 

# How it went
It was such a struggle to implement since I had to be careful in modifying the code while still ensuring it work correctly. The biggest time consumer was the fog and the message log since they were kinda hard to figure out and took a lot longer than initially anticpated. 

# What still needs to be done?
I think still need an endscreen for when you find the kitten. For now I just made it have green text saying you found the kitten, instead of a victory screen.

## Questions and Answers

Question 1: Pick a player experience and feeling to target for this simple game. For example, you might want to make it energizing instead of zenlike, make it a hard grind or a quick jaunt, etc.

**I wanted to make the experience sort of a grind and mystery/uncanny type of vibe.**

Question 2: What choices can you make in objects to enhance this experience? This could include the object's symbol as well as its description.

**To make it more of a grind the symbols for the objects can be randomized to the kitten won't be the same every time the same is loaded. As for making it more of mystery/uncanny, I was thinking of having some object that just doesn't really belong with the other objects. An example could be that this object's description and symbol could be consistant throughout the different games, possibly causing the player to think "hmm that's weird, I wonder if it's intentional".**

After answering Question 2, adapt your object choices in your RFK implementation.

Question 3: What one small and simple enhancement to the game mechanics might enhance the experience you are trying to provide? For example, you might alter the movement commands somehow, add a timer, or whatever â€” sky's the limit as long as it's really easy. (Your game should still be close to the style of RFK after this enhancement. This is not an invitation to create a new game.)

**I want to add a fog around the player so that it both increases the grind aspect and the mystery/uncanny experience that I'm trying to emulate.**

After answering Question 3, make your enhancement.

Question 4: How confident are you that your game is (relatively) bug-free?

**Somewhat confident, since the source code that I referenced is pretty solid in it's implementation. However, I would not be surprise if bugs do pop up since I did make modfications to the code to make it more Robot Finds Kitten style.**

After answering Question 4, do whatever testing and inspection needs to be done to discover and eliminate bugs. Then have at least one player play the game, making notes as they go.

Question 5: What was the playtester's experience? Did it match your expectations?

**The play tester felt a bit frustrated and grind with the fog. Which met the grind exerience I looked for. They felt indifferent about the weeping angel statue.**

Question 6: How does all this correlate with what you've read so far in The Book?

**This correlates with the section "The Designer creates the Experience", where it describes in a section that what I intend for an experience might now what everyone experiences. A good example of this in my Robot Finds Kitten rendition, is how I thought that making one of the objects stand out from the rest would deliever on the experience of mystery when it instead did not.**

Question 7: What would a "AAA" version of your game look like? Is what you have done here helpful in visualizing that? Is the playtesting you've done relevant?

**I think a "AAA" version of my game would be more able to deliver the experience I'm looking for since I was somewhat limited on what I could've done. What I've done here is super helpful in visualizing it since I can kinda feel what is missing to deliver that full experience that I want the player to feel. For example, while I think it is possible to deliver a mysterious experience with a 2d game, I think it will be easier on a 3D version since you can actually feel like you're there more than on a 2d plane. The playtesting I did was super helpful since it gave me a different perspective on how others might percieve my design.**
