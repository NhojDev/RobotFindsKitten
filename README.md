## Questions and Answers

Question 1: Pick a player experience and feeling to target for this simple game. For example, you might want to make it energizing instead of zenlike, make it a hard grind or a quick jaunt, etc.

Feel free to use any open source software you want in your implementation, as long as you cite it in the README.

Please include build-and-run instructions as needed in the README so we can try your thing if desired.

Question 2: What choices can you make in objects to enhance this experience? This could include the object's symbol as well as its description.

After answering Question 2, adapt your object choices in your RFK implementation.

Question 3: What one small and simple enhancement to the game mechanics might enhance the experience you are trying to provide? For example, you might alter the movement commands somehow, add a timer, or whatever â€” sky's the limit as long as it's really easy. (Your game should still be close to the style of RFK after this enhancement. This is not an invitation to create a new game.)

After answering Question 3, make your enhancement.

Question 4: How confident are you that your game is (relatively) bug-free?

After answering Question 4, do whatever testing and inspection needs to be done to discover and eliminate bugs. Then have at least one player play the game, making notes as they go.

Question 5: What was the playtester's experience? Did it match your expectations?

Question 6: How does all this correlate with what you've read so far in The Book?

Question 7: What would a "AAA" version of your game look like? Is what you have done here helpful in visualizing that? Is the playtesting you've done relevant?
